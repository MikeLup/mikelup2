      <h2>Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics: Problems </h2>
      <p>When designing the app, we struggled with and recieved feedback about
          visibility within the app , providing adequate help and documentation for users, and 
          flexibility/efficiency of use.</p>

    <section class="Solutions">
      <h2>Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuiristics: Solutions </h2>
      <p> To address these problems, we implemented several key improvements tied to the corresponding heuristics. 
        For visibility of system status, we changed the color scheme to improve contrast and clarity, ensuring that important actions and system feedback were immediately noticeable to users. 
        To enhance help and documentation, we introduced an onboarding selection to guide new users through the sign-up process and introduce them to the app.
        Regarding flexibility and efficiency of use, we added features like "recent searches" and "most searched" options. These additions helped users complete tasks more quickly by learning from their behavior, thus supporting a more personalized and streamlined experience.
