      <h2>Figma:</h2>
      <p>Figma was used to create the prototype. Drawing some inspiration from Snapchat, the app features a camera setting where images of products can be taken to better understand products as well as a discovery section to find more reccomended products. User searches are also stored and can be favorited to help reccomend products.</p>
    </section>
  
    <section class="feedback">
      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>Throughout the different stages of the project, two of our main focuses were visibility and documentation. This emphasis was reflected in the initial feedback we received, where most comments highlighted these areas. We consistently prioritized making our app clear and accessible while maintaining thorough records to support future understanding and development.
